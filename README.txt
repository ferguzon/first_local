# ORIGINAL README FILE

So this is my first local file. My goal is simple:

1) Update this repo in Github through Git bash
2) Fork the project
3) Change the Readme file in the fork
4) Merge those changes in the original Github project

###FIRST ADDITION 0705PM

#SECOND ADDITION

So this is the second addition. Hopefully I'll make it! :D

###SECOND ADDITION 211015

#THIRD ADDITION

Remeber to send all your changes to the index by doing a "git add -A" or "git add ." and "git add -u". Then, you have to commit them with -git commit -m "comment"-

#FOURTH ADDITION

Ok, so before I leave to my house, I want to make a final test. I'll add this to the index, and then I will commit it, so finally I can push it.
