ORIGINAL README FILE

So this is my first local file. My goal is simple:

1) Update this repo in Github through Git bash
2) Fork the project
3) Change the Readme file in the fork
4) Merge those changes in the original Github project

FIRST ADDITION 0705PM

So this is the second addition. Hopefully I'll make it! :D
